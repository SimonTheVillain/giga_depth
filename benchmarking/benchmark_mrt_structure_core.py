# use to sample mesh: http://www.open3d.org/docs/release/tutorial/geometry/mesh.html#Sampling
# use to calculate normals http://www.open3d.org/docs/latest/tutorial/Advanced/surface_reconstruction.html
# but probably more fitting: http://www.open3d.org/docs/latest/tutorial/Basic/pointcloud.html#Vertex-normal-estimation
# use to apply ICP alignment: http://www.open3d.org/docs/0.7.0/tutorial/Basic/icp_registration.html
# use to render depthmaps (from meshes): https://github.com/intel-isl/Open3D/issues/1152
